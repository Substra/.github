Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It enables the training and validation of machine learning models on distributed datasets. It provides a flexible Python interface and a web application to run federated learning training at scale.

Substra's main usage is in production environments. It has already been deployed and used by hospitals and biotech companies (see the [MELLODDY](https://www.melloddy.eu/) project for instance). Substra can also be used on a single machine to perform FL simulations and debug code.

Substra was originally developed by [Owkin](https://owkin.com/) and is now hosted by the [Linux Foundation for AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/). Today Owkin is the main contributor to Substra.
